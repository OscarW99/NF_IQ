To access a private GitHub repo, you need to put credentials in this file/folder:
$HOME/.nextflow/scm
- see my scm file

Format...

providers {

  github {
    user = 'me'
    password = 'my-personal-access-token'
  }

}



... You generate the personal access token from Settings/Developer Settings/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
'main.nf' and 'nextflow.config' both need to be in the root directory.



To completely remove a pipeline and re-download...
rm -rf ~/.nextflow/assets/OscarW99/NF_IQ
then re pull it using 'nextflow run OscarW99/REPO_NAME'




DOCKER
-------
You can create a docker container for each individual process.
I was thinking it would be better to have a docker container for the whole pipeline however,
having one per process would be better because then you can reuse a process across different pipelines.

'One of the golden rules in Nextflow development is to have a small test dataset that can run the full pipeline in minutes with few computational resources, ie can run on a laptop.'
